# Android-Monitor
Stream and interact with Android screens

Android-Monitor allows the user to stream an Android device screen to their PC.  Once there, the user can send mouse and keyboard commands to the connected device.

To prepare the Android device, enable developer options and turn on USB Debugging.  It is highly recommended to enable "Stay Awake" under developer options as well. 

In addition to keyboard and mouse events, Android-Monitor has built in shortcut keys. These are helpful with physical buttons or Android buttons not visible on the device display.
